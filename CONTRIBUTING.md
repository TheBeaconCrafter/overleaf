Contributing to Beaconleaf
===========================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Beaconleaf! This document outlines how you can help improve this project.

About Beaconleaf
-----------------

Beaconleaf is a fork of Overleaf Community Edition that extends it with useful features that are **not likely to be merged into upstream Overleaf**. The goal is to provide enhancements that benefit the community while maintaining compatibility with the upstream project.

**Important**: If you discover a bug in Overleaf (not specific to Beaconleaf features), please contribute the fix to the [upstream Overleaf repository](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf) rather than here. This ensures that all Overleaf users benefit from the fix, and helps maintain compatibility between Beaconleaf and upstream.

Reporting Bugs and Opening Issues
----------------------------------

If you'd like to report a bug or open an issue, please **[check if there is an existing issue](https://github.com/TheBeaconCrafter/overleaf/issues)** first.
If one exists, please add any additional information you have, or give it a 👍.

When submitting an issue, please describe it as clearly as possible, including:
- How to reproduce the bug
- Which situations it appears in
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happens
- Whether this is a bug in Beaconleaf-specific features or in the base Overleaf functionality

If you can include a screenshot for front-end issues, that is very helpful.

**Note**: 
- For bugs in base Overleaf functionality, please report them to the [upstream Overleaf repository](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/issues)
- For bugs specific to Beaconleaf features (Dark Mode, Administrator Tools, Symbol Palette, etc.), please report them here

Pull Requests
-------------

We welcome pull requests for features that extend Overleaf Community Edition! However, please keep in mind:

- **Feature additions**: We're looking for features that enhance Overleaf but are unlikely to be merged upstream (e.g., global dark mode, administrator tools, symbol palette)
- **Bug fixes**: If you fix a bug in base Overleaf functionality, please contribute it to [upstream Overleaf](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf) instead
- **Beaconleaf-specific bugs**: Fixes for bugs introduced by Beaconleaf features are welcome here

See the [Overleaf wiki](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki) for information on managing the Overleaf development environment and developer guidelines.

If you're looking for something to work on, have a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/TheBeaconCrafter/overleaf/issues).
